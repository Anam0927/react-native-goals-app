# react-native-goals-app

***First react native project (while learning)***

----


This app was the start of my React Native journey and taught me the basics of this technology.

This is a simple, one screen app with
- an input,
- a customised button (using Pressable),
- a modal, and
- a Flatlist which lists all the goals.

The goals are managed locally through state and hence, not yet persistent.

I have also
- used uuid for generating ids fo r each goal,
- added custom fonts, and
- an app wide background color.

That's all, folks!
